# Motivation Journal

Motivation Journal is a journaling app that allows users to create, read, write, and delete (CRUD) journal entries. It leverages a Next.js client with a Ruby on Rails API server and fetches inspirational quotes from a third party API, [Quotable](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable).
